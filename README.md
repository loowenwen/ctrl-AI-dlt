# AgentBTO: Re-Imagining Your Home Buying Decisions with AI
## Group: ctrl-AI-dlt

## Problem we are trying to solve
Deciding on a BTO is often overwhelming. Applicants must weigh many factors—location, price, eligibility rules, and long-term considerations—yet information is scattered across multiple sources (websites, forums, Telegram groups, etc.). This makes it difficult for individuals and families to consolidate insights and make confident decisions.

## Why it matters for the Public Good
Current resources are too general and rarely personalised. As a result, many applicants gravitate toward the same projects, lowering their chances of success and prolonging the path to home ownership. With stringent restrictions and limited opportunities to ballot, making an informed and well-matched BTO decision is not only stressful but also critically important for individuals, families, and society at large.
